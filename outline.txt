Project: games inventory
Goal: create a editable library for the games i own so i can play through my catalogue.

Code Layers:
--HTML--
CSS for design
Maybe JS for the buttons? Going to see if php can do this though since my focus with this project is to use as much php as possible

--PHP--
Check added games against the database, throw an error if the game already exists in the database

Utilize MySql and Apache2
